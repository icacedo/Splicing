Notes about what I'm doing here in homologues2/
Need to make a gene build for every worm genome and any other genomes we want to
 compare.
Goal is to BLAST the APC gene build against every other gene build.
We are using C. elegans genome build WS282, all other genomes to be compared 
against should use the same build number.
Also using C. elegans strain PRJNA13758
To get the gene builds, follow:
Wormbase > Downloads > Public HTTPS site > releases/ > WS282/ > species/
Need the gff3.gz and genomic.fa.gz files.
Use haman in grimoire to make gene builds.
