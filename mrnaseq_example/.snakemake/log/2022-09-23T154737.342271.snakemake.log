MissingOutputException in rule run_hts_stats in line 4 of /home/izzy/Code/Splicing/mrnaseq_example/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
HTS_testing/SRR5811862.subset.stats_SE.fastq.gz completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 0
Removing output files of failed job run_hts_stats since they might be corrupted:
HTS_testing/SRR5811862.subset.stats.json
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
